# Lane-Detection-using-OpenCV

detector.py - is the file used for lane detection. Similarly, a video can also be used.
There can be other detections as well like face and eye for which we use-
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml 

We are also able to detect shapes like circle or corner using Harris corner
